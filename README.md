# Animation Transform Offset

A simple Blender addon that offsets entire animations while transforming objects. Use Shift+G/R/S to move, rotate, or scale objects and automatically offset their animation curves by the same amount(each keyframe will add or substract delta transform to your new location). Works with multiple objects and preserves relative animation motion.

## Usage
Select animated object(s), press Shift+G/R/S or use the buttons in the Animation tab (N-panel), transform normally, and confirm.
